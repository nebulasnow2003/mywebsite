<h1 style = "color: white"> Why I like heroes...
<h2 style = "color: powderblue">
  <p style = "fontSize: 80"> The reason I realized I liked superheroes so much was because I had to list the books I had read in the past 12 months. As I was racking my brain, I realized that there was a pattern. SO MANY of the books I had read had to do with heroes or superpowers!
   <div> I hadn't really thought about it before then, but I really like the idea of enhanced humans. I know it wouldn't work in the real world, but a girl can dream.
    <div> I just love readin about power rushing through veins, about people being able to do things they shouldn't be able to do. It kinda gives me hope, in a way. I will happily read books about villians, heroes, normal people who came across powers by chance... I'll read it all.
     <div> As the final segment, I would like to tell you who I would be if I was a hero.
      <div> I always loved to idea of flying. However, not the normal 'jump and go'. I want wings. They would be big, feathered. I would use them to fly, dive, be a hero. Yes, I am well aware that they would be very difficult to live with. I would wear long coats/vests to hide my wings when they were not in use. Now, that's not all I would have. Awhile ago, I thought flying would be enough. Then I changed my mind. I would also have electricity manipulation. So, I would be like Thor without a hammer. My hero name would be 'Thunderbird'.
       <div> And that's that.
