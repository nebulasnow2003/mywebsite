    <div> I guess you could say I have always been singing. Whether I was seven and in a restaraunt bathroom or sixteen and singing on an album,I sing every chance I get.
    <div> People say I have a nice voice, and I am starting to believe them. For a long time, I didn't really know how to use my voice. I still don't, but I am still learning. I like to call my voice my 'maple syrup'. It flows out sweet and thick.
    <div> My favorite band is Imagine Dragons. Their music always has meaning and is always good. I cannot sing all of their songs (the key doesn't always work for me), but that won't always stop me from belting out some lyrics.
