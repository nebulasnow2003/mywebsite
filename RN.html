<h1> Why I like to run...
<h2>
  <p style = "fontSize: 80"> I didn't always enjoy running. It all started when I wanted to become more active. Not too much more active, just a little bit. I had a friend who ran Cross Country, and I asked her if she liked it. I got told stories and experiences, finally deciding that I wanted to give it a try.
    <div> So I showed up to practice.
    <div> For the first couple of weeks, I counted make a full rotation around the half-mile track. It was so embarrassing! I seriously thought about quitting. Thankfully, I didn't. Each day I realized that I could run faster, longer. Soon enough, three or four miles didn't seem like that much.
    <div> Then came the first meet. I was FREAKING OUT. We were stretching, I was shaking. We were drinking water, I was afraid of throwing up. I thought I was going to get sick and be unable to run. And, honestly, I wasn't going to be too mad if I was unable to compete. Then they had us line up. I heard the gun go off, so I started going.
    <div> The time past so fast, I barely even realized I was going a 5k. I finished, running across the finish line to see that my coach was in utter shock!
    <div> I had done a lot better than any of us had expected.
    <div> Since then, I have enjoyed running.
