    <div> To be honest, I didn't always like coffee. When I was much younger, I wouldn't touch ANY form of the stuff. Then I tried a frappe.
    <p> It changed my life.
    <p> Well, that's a little dramatic. It introduced me to a form of coffee I was okay to drink. Mostly because it had barely any coffee in it. For a long time, the only coffee I would drink was a frappe. Then, I decided to try hot coffee one day.
    <p> It changed my life.
    <p> This time, that is a little more true. All of a sudden, many more drinks were available to me! I could have lattes, macchiatos, cappucinos, and many more. However, I could still only drink my 'coffee' if I could barely taste the coffee. My final evolution was when I stopped putting stuff in my coffee at home. In other words, I started drinking black coffee. Turns out, I really like it! Since then, I've loved all coffee.
