<h1> Why I like to discover...
<h2 style = "color: teal">
  <p style = "fontSize: 80"> I have a wild imagination.
    <p> That is just one reason I enjoy adventures. Another is that I get bored easily. All joking aside, I love finding new things, trying new things, EATING new things... It is just fun for me. I do have fears, I won't openly hold a spider if I know nothing about it. However, if it there are safety measures, I will do just about anything.
