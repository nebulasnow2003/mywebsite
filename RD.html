<h1> Why I like to read...
<h2 style = "color: marigold">
  <p style = "fontSize: 80"> I didn't REALLY start to read until I was 8.
    <p> My sister had taught herself how to read long before I was even thinking about it. When it was my turn to learn how to read, I didn't want to, so my mother didn't bother trying to make me.
     <p> The result was me not reading for a long time.
      <p> I really started reading when I found a series called 'The Fairy Realm'. The topics and adventure tickled my young mind. Not to mention the series was about a dozen books long. I completely turned my reading attitude around. I went from hating to read to begging to go to the library.
       <p> My mother was very satisfied, and I haven't stopped reading since. I love taking home a plethora of topics.
