  <p style = "fontSize: 80"> Previous to the summer of 2019, I had never coded before. I thought it would be fun to learn but I never got around to actually doing it. 
   <div> That is, until I did Girls Who Code.
    <div> It was a huge opportunity! Seven weeks of nothing but learning computer science. Each day I went in, ready to learn something new. Some things were easy, some things were hard. It was all about understanding, problem-solving, and persistence. I also found out that Google is helpful!
    <div> I don't want to major in computer science, but I am so happy I learned how to code. 
     <div> I think that coding is something that everyone should learn to do, even if they only learn a little bit. I am proud that I can code some pretty complex things and that I can understand a lot of code too. I 'speak nerd', which is helpful for understanding code and helping others fix bugs. I am proud of what I know, and I hope to never forget it.
